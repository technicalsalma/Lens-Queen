            2. Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
            implement authentication?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I'm using Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in to my
            app using one or more sign-in methods, including email address and
            password sign-in, and federated identity providers such as Google
            Sign-in and Facebook Login.Firebase Authentication makes it easier
            to get our users signed-in without having to understand the
            complexities behind implementing your own authentication
            system.Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user
            name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards,
            retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.
